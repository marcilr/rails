MVC - Model–view–controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly
  used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into
  three interconnected parts.  This is done to separate internal
  representations of information from the ways information is presented
  to and accepted from the user.  The MVC design pattern decouples these
  major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel
  development.
