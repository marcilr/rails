You can see all of the command line options that the
Rails application builder accepts by running:
  rails new -h

To create a new blog application:

$ rails new blog
...
In Gemfile:
  coffee-rails was resolved to 4.2.2, which depends on
    railties was resolved to 5.1.4, which depends on
      rake
         run  bundle exec spring binstub --all
bundler: command not found: spring
Install missing gem executables with `bundle install`
$

To fix this:

# aptitude install libsqlite3-dev   <=== Needed by next command:

blog$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
The dependency tzinfo-data (>= 0) will be unused by any of \
the platforms Bundler is installing for. Bundler is installing \
for ruby but the dependency is only for x86-mingw32, x86-mswin32, \
x64-mingw32, java. To add those platforms to the bundle, run \
`bundle lock --add-platform x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32 x64-mingw32 java`.

NOTE: Had to give marcilr sudo privileges for the above to work:
      # sudo usermod -a -G sudo marcilr

I think the above added marcilr to the sudo group
in /etc/group:
  sudo:x:27:marcilr


4. Start the web server:
$ bin/rails server
/var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.1/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:84:in \
`rescue in block (2 levels) in require': There was an error while trying \
to load the gem 'uglifier'. (Bundler::GemRequireError)
Gem Load Error is: Could not find a JavaScript runtime. \
See https://github.com/rails/execjs for a list of available runtimes.

blog$ 

This will fire up Puma, a web server distributed with Rails
by default.  To see your application in action, open a browser
window and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Nothing on http://localhost:3000


In the blog/Gemfile uncommented:
gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby

blog$ bin/rails server
Could not find gem 'therubyracer' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile.
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
blog$ 

Resolve therubyracer for JavaScript dependency:

blog$ bundle install
The dependency tzinfo-data (>= 0) will be unused by any of the \
platforms Bundler is installing for. Bundler is installing for \
ruby but the dependency is only for x86-mingw32, x86-mswin32, \
x64-mingw32, java. To add those platforms to the bundle, run \
`bundle lock --add-platform x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32 x64-mingw32 java`.
