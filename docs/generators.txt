Generators


Ruby scripts called generators to facilitate building applications


Rails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are
designed to make your development life easier by creating everything
that's necessary to start working on a particular task.  One of
these is the new application generator, which will provide you with
the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that you don't have
to write it yourself.[1]

To use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory
where you have rights to create files, and type:

$ rails new blog

This will create a Rails application called Blog in a blog directory
and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in Gemfile
using bundle install.

If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux then there are currentl
some limitations on file system notifications that mean you should
disable the spring and listen gems which you can do by running
rails new blog --skip-spring --skip-listen.

You can see all of the command line options that the Rails application
builder accepts by running rails new -h.
