Dockerfile
  Defines exactly what needs to be in the container

docker-compose.yml
  "...docker-compose.yml is where the magic happens.  This file describes
  the services that comprise your app (a database and a web app),
  how to get each one’s Docker image (the database just runs on a
  pre-made PostgreSQL image, and the web app is built from the current
  directory), and the configuration needed to link them together and
  expose the web app’s port."

  Tip: You can use either a .yml or .yaml extension for this file.
