NOTE: ruby-dev is required by rails:
  $ gem install rails
  Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
  ERROR:  Error installing rails:

3. To install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems
$ gem install rails

$ type rails
rails is hashed (/usr/local/bin/rails)
$

$ rails --version
Rails 5.1.5
$

$ type rails
rails is hashed (/usr/local/bin/rails)
$

Looks good!

4. Keep rails up to date:
$ gem update rails
Updating installed gems
Nothing to update
$

5. Install sqlite3 SQL database engine:
# aptitude install sqlite3
# aptitude install sqlite3-doc

$ sqlite3 --version

Informing RubyGems of Debian Packages[1]
=====================================
In the default installation, RubyGems is not aware of any gems which have
been installed through the Debian package managers.  Although this doesn’t
cause any serious problems, since the installation locations are different,
it may result in duplicate copies of gems being installed, causing
confusion and wasting space and bandwidth.  The solution to this problem is
very simple, ensure that RubyGems is installed from a Debian package
(either the rubygems[2] package for Ruby 1.8 or by using the Debian package
for Ruby 1.9, which includes RubyGems), then install the
rubygems-integration[3] package through a Debian package manager
(e.g. apt-get install rubygems-integration).

Once this is done, RubyGems will use already-installed Debian package gems
to satisfy dependencies and won’t install a second copy of such gems.  Note
however that this will not, as far as I am aware, cause gem to install a
Debian package to satisfy a dependency if one is available.  The user must
first install the Debian package, if one is available, for it to be used.
