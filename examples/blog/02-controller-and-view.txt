Controller and View


4.2 Say "Hello", Rails[1]

To get Rails saying "Hello", you need to create at minimum
a controller and a view.

A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for
the application. Routing decides which controller receives
which requests.  Often, there is more than one route to
each controller, and different routes can be served by
different actions. Each action's purpose is to collect
information to provide it to a view.

A view's purpose is to display this information in a human
readable format.  An important distinction to make is that
it is the controller, not the view, where information is
collected. The view should just display that information.
By default, view templates are written in a language called
eRuby (Embedded Ruby) which is processed by the request
cycle in Rails before being sent to the user.

To create a new controller, you will need to run the
"controller" generator and tell it you want a controller
called "Welcome" with an action called "index", just like
this:

  $ bin/rails generate controller Welcome index          <===
  Rails will create several files and a route for you.

  create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
   route  get 'welcome/index'
  invoke  erb
  create    app/views/welcome
  create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
  invoke  test_unit
  create    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb
  invoke  helper
  create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
  invoke    test_unit
  invoke  assets
  invoke    coffee
  create      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.coffee
  invoke    scss
  create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss

Most important of these are of course the controller,
located at app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb and the
view, located at app/views/welcome/index.html.erb.

Open the app/views/welcome/index.html.erb file in your   <===
text editor. Delete all of the existing code in the
file, and replace it with the following single line
of code:

<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>


Executing the above:
$ cd blog/
$ rails generate controller Welcome index 
Running via Spring preloader in process 2866
      create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
       route  get 'welcome/index'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/welcome
      create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss
$ 

Edit app/views/welcome/index.html.erb file.
Delete all of the existing code in the file,
and replace it with the following single line
of code:

  <h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>

$ nano app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
<h1>Welcome#index</h1>
<p>Find me in app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</p>
  Updated to:
<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>
