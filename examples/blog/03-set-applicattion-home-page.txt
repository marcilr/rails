Set Application Home Page [1]


Now that we have made the controller and view, we need to tell
Rails when we want "Hello, Rails!" to show up.  In our case,
we want it to show up when we navigate to the root URL of our
site, http://localhost:3000.  At the moment, "Welcome aboard"
is occupying that spot.

Next, you have to tell Rails where your actual home page is
located.

Open the file config/routes.rb in your editor.

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    get 'welcome/index'
 
    # For details on the DSL available within this file, see
   http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  end

This is your application's routing file which holds entries
in a special DSL (domain-specific language) that tells Rails
how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions.
Edit this file by adding the line of code root
'welcome#index'. It should look something like the following:

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    get 'welcome/index'
 
    root 'welcome#index'
  end

root 'welcome#index' tells Rails to map requests to the root
of the application to the welcome controller's index action
and get 'welcome/index' tells Rails to map requests to
http://localhost:3000/welcome/index to the welcome controller's
index action.  This was created earlier when you ran the
controller generator (bin/rails generate controller Welcome
index).

Launch the web server again if you stopped it to generate the
controller (bin/rails server) and navigate to
http://localhost:3000 in your browser.  You'll see the
"Hello, Rails!" message you put into
app/views/welcome/index.html.erb, indicating that this new
route is indeed going to WelcomeController's index action
and is rendering the view correctly.

For more information about routing, refer to Rails Routing
from the Outside In.[2]


Executed:

Tell rails where home page is located:

$ nano config/routes.rb 
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end

  Updated to:

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'
 
  root 'welcome#index'
end

Run web server and verify new "Hello, Rails!"

$ cd blog/
$ rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.1.5 application starting in development 
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.11.3 (ruby 2.3.3-p222), codename: Love Song
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop

Open http://loclhost:3000

Now get:
Hello, Rails!

Looks good!
